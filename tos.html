                                        We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms, will govern our relationship with You. We will try to notify You of material revisions, for example via a service notification or an email to the email associated with Your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, You agree to be bound by the revised Terms.

All disputes related to these Terms or the Services will be brought solely in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia or state courts in DeKalb County, Georgia. You consent to the personal jurisdiction of any such forum, waive any venue-related objections as to any such forum, and waive any right to seek transfer of any dispute related to these Terms or the Services to another forum.
